<h2>Christyan Bravo</h2>
<h2>Chris</h2>
<p>Hello! Let me introduce myself. I am 28 years old. I am from Guayaquil, Ecuador. It is a coastal
    city so it is always hot, even when it rains.</p>
<p>I met the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints when I was 16 but got baptized until I was 18
    because of many problems that were going through in my family. I served on a mission in Cuzco, Per√∫</p>
<p>Currently, I am married to a wonderful woman named Whendoly. She is from Peru. We live now in Arequipa, Peru.</p>
<p>We have a beautiful baby who is 1 year and almost 5 months old.</p>
<p>I am pursuing a bachelor's in technology through BYU-Pathway and BYU-Idaho. I
love technology, gettingto know things on websites, building websites. Watching weird code
turn into beautiful and amazing web pages can be very exciting.</p>
<p>I love soccer. My favorite teams are FC Barcelona from Spain, and Barcelona Sporting CLub from Ecuador</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my web page.</p>
